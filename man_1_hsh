.SH OPTIONS
The shell v2 (
.B hsh
) takes options, e.g.
.B ls -la, cat [
.I filename
.B ],
parsing the string and separating each argument. Whenever there is a
.B '-',
.B hsh
shell v2 interpreter will identify it as an
.I option.
.PP
If the
.I option
is not a valid
.I option,
.B hsh
will output an error message with an invalid or not found message.
.PP
If you have any questions on the usage of the options for each command check its man page (
.B man ls, man echo, man cat,
etc.).

.B Examples:
.P
.SY ls
.OP -la
will list the files and directories with detailed information like the permissions, size, owner, etc.
.P
.SY wc
.OP -l FILE...

.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument will always be assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. These shell commands are stored in the
.B /bin
folder.
.B Hsh
shell receives the command name, e.g.
.B ls, cat, echo, date, mkdir, touch, mv,
etc. or can also receive the path to the command, e.g.
.B /bin/ls, /bin/cat, /bin/echo,
etc.
