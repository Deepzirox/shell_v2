.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Hsh
is an interactive interface that allows users to execute commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX based operatin systems. The shell lets the user interact internally with the system by using built-in functions. When a user types in a command, this is interpreted as an input that will execute a program. Once the program is finished, it will display an output.
.SH OPTIONS
The shell v2 (
.B hsh
) takes options, e.g.
.B ls -la, cat [
.I filename
.B ],
parsing the string and separating each argument. Whenever there is a
.B '-',
.B hsh
shell v2 interpreter will identify it as an
.I option.
.PP
If the
.I option
is not a valid
.I option,
.B hsh
will output an error message with an invalid or not found message.
.PP
If you have any questions on the usage of the options for each command check its man page (
.B man ls, man echo, man cat,
etc.).
.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument will always be assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. These shell commands are stored in the
.B /bin
folder.
.B Hsh
shell receives the command name, e.g.
.B ls, cat, echo, date, mkdir, touch, mv,
etc. or can also receive the path to the command, e.g.
.B /bin/ls, /bin/cat, /bin/echo,
etc.
.PP
If
.B hsh
is invoked this way,
.B $0
is the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments ([
.I option
], [
.I argument
]).
.B Hsh
reads and executes commands from the file, then exits. If no command is executed,
.B hsh
will return exit status 0.
